Interviewing for Product Design Roles: 7 Tips

At Slack, we’re hiring again. That means I’m reviewing quite a few portfolios and sitting in on case study presentations. This is some of my favorite work because you get to see all the different ways designers approach and solve problems. And I don’t just mean the problem of designing a product. I also mean the “problem” of acquiring a new job.

Over time, you start to notice patterns in what tends to resonate with hiring teams and what doesn’t. The designers who stand out are usually not just strong craft designers. They are practical builders who can move work forward, and collaborators who make teams better without needing to dominate the room. Below is a bit of a brain dump of things I consistently see working and not working in how designers present their work and apply to roles.

Applying

Referrals are king. I can’t emphasize this enough. Applying via a referral increases your chances of making it to the next round by 3 to 4x. When someone already at the company submits your application, recruiting and the hiring manager tend to take extra care in the review.

You probably only need 2 to 3 projects in your portfolio. For a recent role at Slack, we received over 400 applications. Reviewers are moving quickly. I might spend 30 to 90 seconds on an initial pass. Depth matters more than volume.

Only show your best work. Reviewers are forming a fast read on your judgment and taste. One weaker project can dilute the signal from a strong one.

Double check your password. I can’t tell you how many candidates were automatically rejected because the password didn’t work or wasn’t included. If your portfolio is protected, test the full experience before submitting.

Skip “Coming Soon” projects. It’s very unlikely a reviewer comes back later. Put the work you want evaluated front and center.

Interviewing

Practice. Seriously. Treat this like a real presentation you would give to leadership or a client. I’m paying attention not just to the work itself, but how clearly you communicate and bring others along in your thinking.

Show how you build, not just what you designed. Strong candidates demonstrate how they navigated constraints, worked with partners, and actually got something shipped. The job is rarely clean or perfectly scoped.

Collaboration matters more than heroics. The best candidates show how they worked with PMs, engineers, researchers, and other designers to move the work forward. Teams are looking for people who raise the collective quality of the group, not lone geniuses.

Tell the story of decisions. Help us understand tradeoffs, disagreements, and how alignment was reached. This signals maturity and real-world experience.

Use big pictures. I often see designers trying to fit an entire 1400px UI onto a slide. Once shared over Zoom, it becomes impossible to read. When discussing a detail, zoom in and focus attention on exactly what you want people to see.

I’ll keep adding to this list as I think of more tips.
