            Don’t make the mistake I made of assuming real real state investors buy larger rental
            properties like apartment buildings and office buildings. After 54 years in the
            business, I figured out that “There’s no place like home” for your real estate
            investment money.  $34.95 8 1/2 x 11 paperback 189 pages Most favored investment Houses
            get about two dozen special good deals not available to other investments. Income tax
            deductions and exclusions, financing terms, personal loan liability, HECMs, life
            estates, property tax discounts, very small political risk, bankruptcy homestead
            exemptions in some states, not counted for Medicaid eligibility and many college loans,
            you can live in it, and more. Any disadvantages? You cannot put it into your IRA or
            401(k). But it already has the main benefit of those pension plans or better—tax

          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            A Pigouvian tax (also spelled Pigovian tax) is a tax on any market activity that
            generates negative externalities (i.e., external costs incurred by third parties that
            are not included in the market price). A Pigouvian tax is a method that tries to
            internalize negative externalities to achieve the Nash equilibrium and optimal Pareto
            efficiency.&#91;1&#93; The tax is normally set by the government to correct an
            undesirable or inefficient market outcome (a market failure) and does so by being set
            equal to the external marginal cost of the negative externalities. In the presence of
            negative externalities, social cost includes private cost and external cost caused by
            negative externalities. This means the social cost of a market activity is not covered
            by the private cost of the activity. In such a case, the market outcome is not efficient
            and may lead to over-consumption of the product.&#91;2&#93; Often-cited examples of
            negative externalities are environmental pollution and increased public healthcare costs
            associated with tobacco and sugary drink consumption.&#91;3&#93;

            An overview of what calculus is all about, with an emphasis on making it seem like
            something students could discover for themselves. The central example is that of
            rediscovering the formula for a circle's area, and how this is an isolated instance of
            the fundamental theorem of calculus

            Featured in courses at Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, CMU and others In the previous
            post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models.
            Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation
            applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses
            attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer
            outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest
            benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is
            in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use
            their Cloud TPU offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it
            functions. The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A
            TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package.
            Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In
            this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one
            by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of
            the subject matter. 2020 Update: I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a
            gentler approach to the topic: A High-Level Look Let’s begin by looking at the model as
            a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in
            one language, and output its translation in another.

            >8 Tips for Returning to Work After Parental Leave</a
          >
          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            Transitioning back to work after your parental leave is challenging. You’ve been out of
            the flow of the office for months and your mind might be elsewhere. How can you ensure a
            smooth reentry? Start by reflecting on your goals. Prior to your return, think about how
            you can best contribute to your organization. Consider what you need to do to fulfill
            your responsibilities and foster your career in a way that also allows you to be a good
            parent. Once you’re back, sit down with your manager and convey your excitement about
            your return. Acknowledge that your adjustment may be bumpy, but that you’re fully
            committed to your job and organization. Discuss the future. Talk about professional
            development. Bring up projects you’d like to be considered for, initiatives you’re
            interested in pursuing, and work travel that you’re willing to do — or not do. Your goal
            is to reset your expectations for yourself.

          >
          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            The systematic thinking in our industry is that settings are the result of design
            failure. As designers, our goal is to create product experiences that don’t require any
            adjustment by the user. So offering customization options is often seen as a failure to
            make firm product decisions. I think there is a misunderstanding about what settings
            really are.

            In this post I look at how SwiftUI manages state with Combine, and how it compares to
            using React with Redux. SwiftUI is Apple's new declarative UI framework for developing
            UI natively, while React is a declarative UI framework for the web.

            Earlier in our careers, speed and energy are important components. But there comes a
            point where you actually can’t speed up any more. You need to rely less on what you can
            personally achieve (your “ego-drive”) and more on what you can achieve with others (your
            “co-drive”). Instead of being energetic, you need to become energizing. Instead of
            setting the pace, you need to teach others to self-propel. Instead of delegating, you
            need to allow people to congregate. As you shift from proving yourself to helping others
            perform, your key question is not “How can I push harder?” but “Where can I let go?”

          >
          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            Reprint: R0406C An effective executive does not need to be a leader in the typical sense
            of the word. Peter Drucker, the author of more than two dozen HBR articles, says some of
            the best business and nonprofit CEOs he has worked with over his 65-year consulting
            career were not stereotypical leaders. They ranged from extroverted to nearly reclusive,
            from easygoing to controlling, from generous to parsimonious. What made them all
            effective is that they followed the same eight practices: They asked, “What needs to be
            done?” They also asked, “What is right for the enterprise?” They developed action plans.
            They took responsibility for decisions. They took responsibility for communicating. They
            were focused on opportunities rather than problems. They ran productive meetings. And
            they thought and said “we” rather than “I.” The first two practices provided them with
            the knowledge they needed. The next four helped them convert this knowledge into
            effective action, for knowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated
            into deeds. The last two ensured that the whole organization felt responsible and
            accountable. Effective executives know that they have authority only because they have
            the trust of the organization. This means they must think of the needs and opportunities
            of the organization before they think of their own needs and opportunities. The author
            also suggests a ninth practice that’s so important, he elevates it to the level of a
            rule: Listen first, speak last. The demand for effective executives is much too great to
            be satisfied by those few people who are simply born to lead. Effectiveness is a
            discipline. And, like every discipline, it can be learned and must be earned.

          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            One of the most difficult transitions for leaders to make is the shift from doing to
            leading. As a new manager you can get away with holding on to work. Peers and bosses may
            even admire your willingness to keep “rolling up your sleeves” to execute tactical
            assignments. But as your responsibilities become more complex, the difference between an
            effective leader and a super-sized individual contributor with a leader’s title is
            painfully evident. To raise the ceiling of your leadership potential, you need to extend
            your presence through the actions of others, engaging people so that they contribute
            their best work to your shared priorities. To set the table for effective delegation,
            make sure you express why something is important to you, confirm that your expectations
            for the work have been clearly communicated, ask how much of your involvement they need,
            and practice saying no. Don’t let a focus on execution hold you back from the
            big-picture work of leading. If you delegate with these principles in mind, the work
            will get done, because the right people will be focused on the right tasks.

          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            If you find yourself frequently miscommunicating with your team, hearing about issues at
            the last minute, or misunderstanding how your team sets priorities, it may be a sign
            you’ve delegated too much. To get re-involved, start by taking on a symbolic project
            that will send a signal you’re re-engaging, and help you re-learn some of the front-line
            skills you need to have a deep understanding of the work your team is doing. Second,
            re-set expectations with your team. An off-site or planning meeting can help set a new
            agenda. Third, double-down on communicating your vision for your team. If people know
            why they’re doing what they’re doing, or the major goals they should be working toward,
            they shouldn’t need you to be super-involved in their day-to-day efforts.

            The inflated ego that comes with success – the bigger salary, the nicer office, the easy
            laughs – often makes us feel as if we’ve found the eternal answer to being a leader. But
            the reality is, we haven’t. An inflated ego makes us susceptible to manipulation; it
            narrows our field of vision; and it corrupts our behavior, often causing us to act
            against our values. Breaking free of an overly-protective or inflated ego and avoiding
            the leadership bubble is an important and challenging job that requires selflessness,
            reflection, and courage.

            >How I Managed High-Stakes Crises at the Pentagon</a
          >
          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            National security routinely involves life-and-death decisions that must be made under
            the extreme scrutiny that goes along with doing the people’s business. This is
            especially true at America’s single largest institution: the Department of Defense.
            While the Pentagon may be in a class by itself when it comes to organizational
            complexity and high-stakes decision making, nearly all business leaders can expect to be
            confronted with crises that may threaten their organization’s reputation and perhaps
            even its survival. In this article, a former U.S. secretary of defense explains that a
            high-stakes situation requires more than a communications plan — it also requires a
            workplace culture where people are encouraged to face problems with integrity,
            accountability, and tenacity. He describes his checklist of actions for communicating
            with transparency and taking responsibility during a crisis.

            Did you know that you can incorporate Vue into your project the same way that you would
            incorporate jQuery — with no build step necessary? Let's cover some common use cases in
            jQuery and how we can switch them over to Vue, and why we’d even want to do so. In this
            article Sarah Drasner shows you that Vue is also a pretty nice abstraction for small
            sites that don’t need a lot of overhead. Due to Vue’s flexibility, it’s also easy to
            transition this code to a build step and component structures if you’d like to adopt a
            more complex structure over time. It’s actually pretty fun to try it out!

            being smart enough to learn it. My biggest excuse, though, is that I simply don’t have
            the time. This is a particularly misguided excuse because it’s just true enough to
            discourage me from trying things, and just false enough to make me feel guilty about not

            where to start. This is part one of a three-part series outlining my personal approach

            cultivate this triad of awareness, in abundance and in the proper balance, because a
            failure to focus inward leaves one rudderless, a failure to focus on others renders one
            clueless, and a failure to focus outward may cause one to be blindsided. The good news
            is that practically every form of focus can be strengthened. The author of Emotional
            Intelligence, Social Intelligence, and many other books on the power of cultivating
            awareness explains why focus is crucial to great leadership. Focused leaders can command
            the full range of their own attention: They are in touch with their inner feelings, they
            can control their impulses, they are aware of how others see them, and they can weed out
            distractions and also allow their minds to roam widely, free of preconceptions.

            (or, more generally, any container element) that have a non-rectangular shape. Such as

            Note from Will: this article series is the result of a friendly debate I had with Troy
            regarding the best approach for founders to take when building a financial model. More
            accurately, the “debate” was a strong adverse reaction from Troy after I shared a
            template I built for Prota Ventures’ portfolio companies. His feedback was, essentially,
            to never use a template and instead build each model from scratch. He invited me to a
            90-minute lecture he gave where he overwhelmingly convinced me and the room that,
            indeed, founders need to take the time necessary to build their models from scratch.
            After I asked him where I could find his lecture material online, he suggested we
            co-author this article series since there weren’t many solid resources available. We
            sincerely hope you find this series helpful. Feel free to ping us on Twitter (@wclittle,
            @troyhenikoff) with any questions.

          <div class="bookmark__excerpt">
            Reprint: R1401F Strategy making forces executives to confront a future they can only
            guess at. It’s not surprising, then, that they try to make the task less daunting by
            preparing a comprehensive plan for how the company will achieve its goal. But good
            strategy is not the product of endless research and modeling; it’s the result of a
            simple process of thinking through how to hit a target and whether it’s realistic to
            try. Discomfort is part of the process. If you are entirely comfortable, you’re probably
            stuck in one or more of the following traps. Strategic planning. Planning arguably makes
            for more thorough budgets, but it must not be confused with strategy. Cost-based
            thinking. Costs lend themselves wonderfully to planning, because the company controls
            them. But for revenue, customers are in charge. Planning can’t make revenue magically
            appear. Self-referential strategy frameworks. Even managers who avoid the first two
            traps may end up using a framework that leads them to design a strategy entirely around
            what the company controls. A company can avoid those traps by focusing on customers,
            recognizing that strategy is about making bets, and articulating the logic behind
            strategic choices.

            components in two blog posts previously. In both posts, comments about viewport based
            units inevitably comes into the picture. I resisted working with viewport units for a
            while, believing that using them would be a pain in the ass because of the calculations
            involved. Last week, I finally overcame the resistance and took a stab at exploring
            viewport units and how to use them in responsive typography.

            Personas have been in use since the mid-’90s and since then have gained widespread
            awareness within the design community. Once Shlomo Goltz understood why personas were
            valuable and how they could be put into action, he started using them in his own work,
            and then his process became more efficient and fun, while the fruits of his labor became
            more impactful and useful to others. Personas will supercharge your work and help you
            take your designs to the next level.

            Just like scientists, designers depend on empirical evidence to prove their hypotheses.
